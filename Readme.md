# C Programming:

# Day 1:

C Pros & Cons

- Pros
    - Fast (compile)
    - Small 
    - Portable (can run any hardware platform)
    - Resource
    - Many Tool or IDE
    - Manage Memory (can access to memory)
    - Access to low level system feature

- Cons
    - Small (There are many APIs)
    - Manage Memory 
    - Runtime checking (no concept)
    - etc.

Lesson:

- Variable
- Operator
- Control Statement
- Array
- Function
- etc 


# Day 2:

- IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment)
- Coding Hello World with C Programming


# Day 3:

- Variables for storing information in memory.

- Naming convention: in C made up of letters and digits,
but the first character must be a letter (not a digit).
The underscore “_” counts as a letter.


# Day 4:

- Data Types and Declarations
**
The data types in C refer to the type of data used to store the information.
**
The syntax for C requires you to write the type
of the variable you want to declare before the variable's name.


# Day 5:

- Constants: values that do not change after they have been defined.
    - Numberic
    - Character
    - String 
    - Enumeration 
    - Const keyword

# Day 6:

- Expressions
    Learn about the Arithmetic, Relational and Equality operators.

# Day 7:

- Type Conversions
    - Implicit Type Conversion
    - Explicit Type Conversion
    - String Function

# Day 8: Increment and Decrement operators

    - (++ and --)
    - When the operand is used before the operand it is call a "prefix operator"
    - When the operand is used after the operand it is call a "postfix operator"

# Day 9: Loops

    Types of loops:
    - For Loop
    - While Loop
    - Do-While Loop


Customer:
    A = balance ($10)
    B = balance ($15)
    C = balance ($25)
    .
    .
    .

for(init_expression; loop_condition; loop_expression) {

}          

while loop

while(condition_expression) {
    //exc
}

do-while loop

do {
    //coding 
}
while(condition_expression)


# Day 10: Condition
    - if, else if, else statements and the conditional operator.

# Day 11: Switch statement

    switch(expression) {
        case value:
            program;
            break;
        case value:
            program;
            break;
        default:
            program;
            break;    
    }

# Day 12: Break and Continue

    break: exis from a loop or switch case statement
    continue: not execute statement
